Hey Valerie,

Thank you for giving me the opportunity to take your tech test.

So I was able to get to this point:

The game loops through the 3 requested screens, by clicking on various buttons
The cards spawn randomly and according to layout rules
A reset button that clears all changes and redeals out the cards
You can click and drag to move cards around
Cards snap to a grid

I did however get stuck on:
Checking whether a card was already present in a space
Ensuring that no duplicate cards got initially created when randomly generating
cards
Cards would properly overlap, so most recently placed would be the visible card
A Unity bug that wipes your scene content

I would, if I had the chance to go back, fix the shuffle to be a randomized 
ordering of the cards into a queue or stack to then be handed out one at a time to
ensure no duplicates.

I had prepared the spaces for a few features, including tying card stats to the 
appropriate cards, as well as creating scripts for the special spaces, but never
had a chance to enter in the code for FreeCells, Foundations or full cascades.

I am not familar with the term JSON I/O so I was not able to implement anything 
related to that that I know of.

Thanks again for letting me take this test, and I look forward to hearing back
from you.
